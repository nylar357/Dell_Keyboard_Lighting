These particular scripts & notifications were designed on and for Ubuntu 20.04 on Openbox Desktop Manager.  I basically wanted a quick script to control my keyboard backlighting, and have that function presented in a notification with a professional level of detail.  The control side of the script is straight forward.  Notifications are pretty easy once installed and just require a little trial and error to get correct.  Choosing your icons is about the most time consuming process if your a perfectionist like me when it comes to uniformity in your desktops visual effects.

If your curious where the directories that give you control of your backlight is:
/sys/class/led/dell::kbd_backlight
